Mod to Hot Topic Smoke Signals RATM shirt

This project is comprised of images to be used to print your own iron-on modifications to a popular band shirt on a color inkjet printer onto Iron-On paper, to hack the message and to protest that most Machine Learning systems are built to productize biases in the humans designing them, and to recognize how much harm comes from machines that are programmed to oppress and harm our people.
